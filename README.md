# CubicOptimal
My attempt at creating a twisty cube optimal solver. Version 0.1.0

The Projects folder contains the .java and .class files. The Tables folder contains some of the tables that I created.
All the tables can be created by the solver. If you attempt to use a table that doesn't exist, it will create it before
continuing to the solve. 

Running the program will most likely require you to raise the memory allocation for java. This can be done in Control Panel -> 
Programs -> Java -> Java -> Runtime Param -> enter size in megabites.
